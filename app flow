Idea of the program:

1. user runs the program 

2. program greets user, 
2.1  and goes on with:
	" to add a new task, click 'OK', or else click cancel
	
	if ok:						if cancel: program shows list of to do's and 
	- input dialog opens up					stops running
	
3. user types  the task, and then clicks ok.

4. program asks user if he is sure that this is what he
	wants to make his task by showing him what he typed:
	
		- if user is sure that that's what he wants he clicks yes.
		
			- the program repeats step 2.1
		- if he decides 'no',
			program returns the previous task and switches it with
			the new/modified task that user wants.
